# WallBreaker

Bypass Paywalls
## About WallBreaker
Paywalls are a staple of the internet and seen in a vast amount of websites.
Encountering a paywall is always annoying, whether youâ€™re doing work for school or
just trying to catch up on the latest news. Popular websites might use paywalls to 
restrict the users entry and cater towards 
those that have some kind of subscription. WallBreaker alerts and ignores all paywalls 
that might impede you while you are surfing the internet.
With custom settings, you can even selectively determine which sites are blocked.
## Installation

To install WallBreaker first download all the files and put it into one folder. 
Then click on the manage extensions button in the upper right of chrome. Make sure
to turn on developer mode and click on the Load unpacked button and select the folder 
you put the files in. After make sure you turn on the extension and it should work.
## Deployment

To enable this project make sure to have the slider turned on in the extension page.
The UI allows the user to customize their experience by selecting from 1-4 sliders 
that can run concomitantly while others can disable certain options. 
Each option has a different function. The user interface is easy to use, with a 
simple interface that lists 4 options to enable or disable with one click. Though
the extensions sport an easy-to-use interface, it does not sacrifice at all in 
functionality, allowing fully for personal customization and flexibility. 



## Features

Our extension has four different methods used to bypass paywalls. These methods 
vary in effectiveness depending on the website and paywall. Our first 
method avoids paywalls by opening the website in a private browsing tab. 
Our second method modifies the HTTP headers to make it seem that we are 
joining the website from a social media site. Our third method disables
cookies on the website. Lastly, our fourth method changes the website 
request to make us look like a GoogleBot.
