Bypass Paywalls


About the Extension
Paywalls are a staple of the internet and seen in a vast amount of websites. Encountering a paywall is always annoying, whether youâ€™re doing work for school or just trying to catch up on the latest news. Popular websites might use paywalls to restrict the users entry and cater towards those that have some kind of subscription. WallBreaker alerts and ignores all paywalls that might impede you while you are surfing the internet. With custom settings, you can even selectively determine which sites are blocked.
